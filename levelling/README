This directory contains historic heights of NAP benchmarks. Specifically:

- levelling_NAP_ZL_20220616_redef.csv - .csv file containing historic NAP heights of benchmarks

- load_levelling_csv_file.ipynb - example notebook for reading the .csv data file

NOTE: some hgt (NAP benchmark heights in meters) values are NaN (Not-a-Number). 
This is e.g. because the NAP re-definition grid was not covering the 
points, or heights are mentioned multiple time in the .xlsx file, and 
only one is used.)
